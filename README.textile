h1=. LIGHTS -- The Listening

A small collection of sheet music for piano and vocalists, arranged just for you by "gcr":http://board.iamlights.com/index.php?/user/794-gcr/.

To do anything at all with this music, you need:
* lilypond (Please use at least 2.12.1; the version in ubuntu jaunty)

To render the complete booklet, you also need:
* inkscape (for rendering the front and back covers. 0.47 is best, but 0.46 might work too)
* imagemagick (for converting the front and back covers into PDFs for ghostscript- very odd, I know)
* ghostscript (for splicing all the PDFs together)
* GNU make (to tie it all together)

To get the whole shebang, run @make@. If you just want an invididual piece, go to that song's folder and run @make@ inside there.

Please understand that it's all largely incomplete. Sorry to disappoint with so little; perhaps one day I can make things right?
