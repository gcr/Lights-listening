h1=. LIGHTS -- The Listening

A small collection of sheet music for piano and vocalists, arranged just for you by "gcr":http://board.iamlights.com/index.php?/user/794-gcr/.

To do anything at all with this music, you need:
* lilypond (Please use at least 2.12.1; the version in ubuntu jaunty)

To render the complete booklet, you also need:
* inkscape (for rendering the front and back covers. 0.47 is best, but 0.46 might work too)
* Microsoft core True Type fonts (her logo is in Impact; not required, but it looks funny without this)
* imagemagick (for converting the front and back covers into PDFs for ghostscript- very odd, I know)
* ghostscript (for splicing all the PDFs together)
* GNU make (to tie it all together)

If you're on ubuntu, do this:
<pre><code>sudo aptitude install inkscape imagemagick msttcorefonts ghostscript make lilypond</code></pre>

To make all the songs and produce individual .PDF files of them, run @make all-songs@. Or, run @make final@ to produce The_Listening.pdf, a .PDF file of every song along with a table of contents. If you want to change the DPI the front and back covers are rendered at, run @make DPI=600 final@. It will take a big long while for everything to render at any DPI above 150 or so, so grab a cup of coffee, eat some lunch, go on a jog, file your income tax returns, start a family, etc., and by the time you're done with all that, it'll be finished and Lights will probably have released about ten other albums.

Please understand that it's all largely incomplete. Sorry to disappoint with so little; perhaps one day I can make things right?
