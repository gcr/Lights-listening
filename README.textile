h1=. LIGHTS -- The Listening

A small collection of sheet music for piano and vocalists, arranged just for you by "gcr":http://board.iamlights.com/index.php?/user/794-gcr/.

To compile a PDF of this booklet, you need:
* lilypond (at least 2.12.1; the version in ubuntu jaunty)
* inkscape (0.47 is best, but 0.46 might work too)
* GNU make (I think)

Run @make@. Go ahead and edit the @Makefile@ if you like.

Please understand that it's all largely incomplete. Hope you enjoy what little I have!
